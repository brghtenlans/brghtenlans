This may sound like a dream come true for borrowers with bad credit; however, lenders offering these types of loans don't know what the risks of lending to you are because they don't know your credit history and will therefore consider your loan the highest risk they can take. This can very well prove detrimental to the borrower as the lenders will more than likely offer unfavorable interest rates and loan terms.

What being 'high risk' means

Being a high risk borrower ultimately means that you'll be placed in a loan with a magnified interest rate. It isn't to cheat you, but lenders have to cover whatever you loan and will usually use a high interest rate to accomplish that. You can expect the interest rate to be between credit cards interest rates and the interest rates offered by payday loans.

As a high risk, you will usually be restricted in the loan amount and may not get the amount you ask for. Often, the lenders will only offer up to about five thousand dollars when lending to borrowers without completing a credit check. To restate, no credit check loans are very reminiscent of payday loans with regards to terms and rates.
